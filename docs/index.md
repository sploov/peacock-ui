## Trusted by Next-Gen Developers

Peacock UI is more than a library; it's a statement. It rejects the flat, boring web of the 2010s and embraces depth, motion, and interactivity.

### Key Principles

1.  **Fluidity over Staticity**: Every interaction should have a consequence.
2.  **Dark Mode First**: Optimized for OLED screens and deep contrast.
3.  **Performance**: Heavy visuals, light footprint. optimized for 60fps+.
