# Introduction

Peacock UI is an aesthetic framework designed to bridge the gap between static interfaces and immersive interactive experiences. Inspired by the sleek, high-end aesthetics of modern productivity tools.

## Core Philosophy

### Fluidity over Staticity
Every component in Peacock UI is designed with motion as a first-class citizen. We don't use simple CSS transitions; we use physics-based springs that react to user input in real-time. This creates a "haptic" feel that makes digital interfaces feel physical.

### Dark Mode First
Peacock UI is built for the modern web. Its default aesthetic is optimized for deep charcoal and neon-accented dark modes, providing a premium feel out of the box.

### High Fidelity
From the "Follow-Mouse" radial glow of our buttons to the backdrop-blur intensity of our menus, every detail is tuned for high-fidelity visual feedback.

## Why Peacock?

In a world of boring, static UI kits, Peacock stands out. It's not just a set of buttons; it's a design language focused on:

- **Performance**: Built on React 19 and Framer Motion 12.
- **Aesthetics**: Glassmorphism, noise textures, and vibrant gradients.
- **Developer Experience**: Fully typed, Tailwind-integrated, and easy to use.
